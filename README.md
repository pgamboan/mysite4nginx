# Personal Portfolio HTML Tailwind

This is a personal portfolio website built as part of my DevOps course, aimed at showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements in the field of software development and operations. Designed with simplicity, clarity, and user experience in mind, this portfolio reflects my journey in the world of DevOps and web development.

This portfolio uses cutting-edge technologies to ensure a seamless and modern experience. The site is built using TailwindCSS Version 4 for responsive design, Vite as the build tool for fast and efficient bundling, and Handlebars.js as the template engine to provide flexibility and easy management of content.
